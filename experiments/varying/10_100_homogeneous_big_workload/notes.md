Here every configurations are linear and close to each others.
Indeed a perfectly homogeneous platform makes it easy to synchronize and for the tasks to flow correctly.

We can still note that here, adding machines makes the total consumption always bigger, but we do notice a nice curve concerning the simulation time.
It means that we can find a sweet spot where adding machines is still worth (even though we always consume more energy), and at some point adding too much machines doesn't affect the simulation time anymore, but the power consumption growth stays linear.
