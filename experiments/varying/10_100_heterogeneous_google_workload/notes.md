Here the results aren't really interesting, they're all linear except for the simulation times.
We see that the Ring topologies perform worse than the others.
However the Star and StarHierarchical topologies perform very well.

A special case concerns StarAsync which already have a good simulation time at start, and adding machines only make the process slower.
