# Varying experiments

Experiments that study a varying criteria and looks for its impact on the total consumption, simulation time and consumption in Watts of each configurations.

A configuration is an combination of a Topology (Star, Ring, Hierarchical) and an Algorithm (here aggregator algorithm: Simple/Async).

Here we vary the number of machines to look how it impacts the general consumption of the systems, and to compare the best configurations in different scenario.

Note that the workload stays the same no matter how much machines we have.
