This file serves as a base for generating the clusters in the varying simulations.

Note that it is also used to generate Hierarchical architectures, and for the sake of the simulation
we assign the profiles from the trainers to the hierarchical aggregators.
By convention, they will take the first profile, so you might put the best profile first.
Then, the sub clusters trainers will have their profiles list reverse to take into account that we
already used one profile for the hierarchical aggregator.
All of this is done to try to respect the number of each profiles among the different simulations.
